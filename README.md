# SPT-BSS (Better Stack Size)

Have you ever wished that certain items could stack? The AA Battery, for example, is too small to occupy an entire slot. This mod reworks item stacking to make it more realistic.

Introducing the [True Items](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1651-true-items/) mod, updated for SPT 3.9.x with improved stack sizes. If you prefer the old stack sizes, you can still copy them from the original True Items mod.

**Warning:** Ensure this mod loads last if you have other mods that modify stack sizes.
